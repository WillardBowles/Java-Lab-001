* In computer jargon, whatâ€™s the difference between a statement and a comment?
* What does it mean to say that a program is portable?
* In common English, what does the word compile mean?
* What is an executable? Why is that word used as a noun?

1.)  Methods are made of statements, Comments explain code   

2.)  Portable languages are able to run on more than one kind of computer.  
  
3.) Compiled code is translated to a language a computer understands, making it execute faster3

4.) Any program on your desktop is an executable. That is why it's used as a noun, because it is an object.
